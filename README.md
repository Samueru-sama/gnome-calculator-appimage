# gnome-calculator-appimage
Test of Gnome Calculator AppImage, not intended for daily-driving yet.

## Known issues / TO-DO

- Build `gnome-calculator` from source instead of relying on Arch repos
- Search provider needs to be integrated to the host's `$HOME` directory for it to work (and maybe some dbus thing?)
- On Fedora, currency conversion doesn't work while it works in other distros, investigating the issue here:
